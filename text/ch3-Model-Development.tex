\subsection{Effect of media FA concentration on TG accumulation and autophagy}

By culturing Huh7 cells in increasing concentrations of OPLA FA mix, intracellular TG content significantly increased (Figure \ref{fig:ch3-Model Development LFHF}a) but despite the substantial increase in TG accumulation, there was no effect on autophagic gene expression (Figure \ref{fig:ch3-Model Development LFHF}b).

\subsection{Effect of media FA concentration on TG accumulation and autophagy}

By culturing Huh7 cells in increasing concentrations of OPLA FA mix, intracellular TG content significantly increased (Figure \ref{fig:LFHF TG}) but despite the substantial increase in TG accumulation, there was no effect on autophagic gene expression (Figure \ref{fig:LFHF ATG genes}).

\subsection{Effect of media FA composition on TG accumulation and autophagy}

Culturing Huh7 cells in predominantly unsaturated (OPLA) or saturated (POLA) FAs resulted in a similar increase in intracellular TG content, when compared to control media free from FAs (Figure \ref{fig:OPLAPOLA TG}). Intracellular TG composition reflected that of the FAs the cells were cultured in (Figure \ref{fig:OPLAPOLA Lipid}). Autophagic flux was then assessed by measuring LC3-II protein intensity (relative to housekeeper protein $\alpha$-Tubulin) with and without the autophagic inhibitor BAF. As LC3-II is normally degraded during autophagy, it's accumulation during autophagic inhibition is reflective of overall autophagic flux \cite{DJ2021Guidelines1}. There was no significant difference in autophagic flux between control, OPLA and POLA conditions, though there was a trend towards a decrease in cells treated with FAs (Figures \ref{fig:OPLAPOLA ATG FLX} - \ref{fig:OPLAPOLA WB Photo}).
